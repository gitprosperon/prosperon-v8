ProsperOn Privacy Policy
<br><br>
Introduction:
<br>
At ProsperOn, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect, how it's used, and the steps we take to protect it. By using our financial education and budgeting application (the "Application"), you consent to the collection, use, and storage of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
Information Collection:
<br>
We collect personal information that you provide to us when you use the Application, such as your name, email address, and financial information. We may also collect information about your device and usage patterns through the use of cookies, analytics tools, and other technologies.
<br><br>
Information Use:
<br>
The personal information we collect is used to provide you with the financial education and budgeting services offered by the Application and to improve the user experience. We may use your information to communicate with you, such as to send you updates, newsletters, or promotional materials.

Information Sharing:
<br>
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for any reason. We may share your information with our partners and service providers who assist us in providing the services offered by the Application, but only as necessary and under strict confidentiality obligations. We may also disclose your information if required by law or to comply with a valid legal process.
<br><br>
Data Protection:
<br>
We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
